# Manydoors Doorbot

ManyLabs has a collaborative DoorBot!  No one owns it; we all manage it together, from this page.

Purpose: Record and share tap-in, tap-out actions of members (with a ISO 14443A keyfob/card) and document workspace usage.

## Getting Started
1. Get a keyfob or keycard (if you have one already, you can use it)
2. Add your rfid number and name/alias to https://github.com/jhpoelen/manydoors/blob/master/ids.csv (ask for help if this is hard for you)
3. Tap-in and Tap-out when entering and leaving ManyLabs by placing your keyfob on the inside/outside facing coils on the door.
4. See your enter/exit actions on the Slack Channel

## features
1. use rfid to record entry/exit at the manylabs door.
2. automatically updates ids from this github repo when new ones are available
3. keeps a local event log on the pi
4. posts a enter/exit events on the [#door channel of manylabs slack](https://manylabs.slack.com/archives/door/)
5. speaks entry/exit message at door
6. *BONUS*: plays silly theme song on entry

## roadmap
* switch from slack web api to streaming bot api; run hubot
* hubot server on RPI
* hubot actions to add/remove tokens
* hubot actions to upload & select silly theme songs

## code setup/ service maintenance
* Login to pi using ```ssh pi@door.local``` (ask for location and access credentials on Slack)


## new setup

### setup slack bot and get token
* create a new slack bot: visit [Manylabs Slack - Custom Integrations](https://manylabs.slack.com/apps/build/custom-integration) and select "Bots"
  * name it `doorbot`
  * save the auth token (note: should begin with `xoxb-`)
  * provide silly user icon
* from your own account within slack:
  * go to the [door](https://manylabs.slack.com/messages/door/) channel (join if necessary)
  * invite our new bot in: `/join @doorbot`
* check that doorbot auth key works:
```
curl -d 'token=<YOUR-BOT-AUTH-KEY-HERE>' \
  -d 'channel=#door' \
  -d 'text=web API chat.postMessage test spaces doorbot-test' \
  -d 'as_user=true' \
  -d 'pretty=1' \
  https://slack.com/api/chat.postMessage
```

### setup raspberry pi
* clone github repo using ```git clone https://github.com/jhpoelen/manydoors.git access_control```
* create a file ```access_control.ini``` with content like:
```
[slack.com]
Token=yourtoken
```
* create symlink to start service ```sudo ln -s /home/pi/rfid/access_control/access_control.conf /etc/init/access_control.conf```
* restart service using ```sudo service access_control restart```
* edit crontab for synching github repo ```crontab -e```
* add ```* * * * * cd /home/pi/rfid/access_control && git pull --rebase```

## existing setup
* go to access_control folder ```cd rfid/access_control```
*  do whenever you need to do, probably ```git pull --rebase``` to get latest changes, or make config changes
*  restart service using ```sudo service access_control restart```
